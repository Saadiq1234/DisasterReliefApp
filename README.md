DisasterReliefApp

A web application built with ASP.NET Core 8 MVC and Entity Framework Core to manage disaster relief operations.
The system supports Identity authentication, role-based access, disaster incident reporting, volunteer coordination, and donation management.

ðŸš€ Quick Start
Prerequisites
.NET 8 SDK
SQL Server (LocalDB, Azure SQL, or full SQL Server)
Setup Instructions

Clone or download the project source code.

Update the connection string in appsettings.json to point to your SQL Server instance.

Open a terminal in the project folder and run:

dotnet restore
dotnet ef database update
dotnet run


Navigate to the app in your browser:

https://localhost:5001

ðŸ‘¤ Admin Account

An admin account is scaffolded with Identity for quick testing:

Email: admin@example.com
Password: Admin123!

Use this account to log in and access the admin dashboard.

ðŸ›  Development Notes

The included migration is a simplified placeholder to get started.
